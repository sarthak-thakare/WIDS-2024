# Week 1

Topics to be covered this week : 
* Essential libraries: Numpy and Matplotlib
* Data Distribution

To make sure that you understand things well, we have given a brief description of the topics followed by links ranging from beginner's to advanced material. It is okay if you don't understand everything in the first go. The topics covered lay the foundations of Machine Learning, so take your time to understand things well. Also, it is not so important to get into everything rigorously, you can do that as per your needs later in the course, but do read the things and get an overall notion.

Assuming you're already familiar with Python, I expect you've worked with Jupyter Notebook. If not, feel free to reach out to me (Pranjal), and I'll provide you with some additional material to get you up to speed.

## Data Visualization using Matplotlib

Before constructing analytical models, a data scientist needs to gain insight into the characteristics and connections within a dataset. The objectives of data exploration and visualization can be summarized into two main goals:
* Grasping the relationships between different data columns.
* Finding features that can be useful for predicting labels in machine learning projects and identifying any redundant or collinear features.

Therefore, being able to visually explore data is a vital skill in data science. In this context, we'll explore how to analyze data using various types of plots provided by the matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

### Useful Resources

Don't worry if you don't understand everything now. It will become more clear once you start implementing them in the assignments.

## Data Distribution 

The data that we have for our model can come from a variety of distributions. Having an understanding of the data distribution helps in making an informed decision about the model that we can use. 
Let us briefly talk about some data distributions -

* **[Bernoulli Distribution](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-bernoulli-and-binomial-distributions-a1eef4e0da8f)** - It has only two outcomes.
* **[Uniform Distribution](https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter4/4_2_1_uniform.php)** - The probability of occurrence of all outcomes is the same.
* **[Normal Distribution](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-normal-distribution.html)** - The probability distribution is given by some expression that forms a bell - shaped curve.

Go through **[this](https://towardsdatascience.com/probability-distributions-in-data-science-cce6e64873a7)** article to go deeper into the various data distributions that are common in Machine Learning.

## Numpy

### Why Numpy?

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a linear algebra library in Python. It is a very important library on which almost every data science or machine learning Python package such as SciPy (Scientific Python), Matâˆ’plotlib (plotting library), Scikit-learn, etc depends on to a great extent.

### What is it used for ?

NumPy is very useful for performing mathematical and logical operations on Arrays. It provides an abundance of useful features for operations on n-arrays and matrices in Python.

One of the main advantages of Numpy is that vectorisation using numpy arrays makes it super time efiicient. It enables parallel computation that makes it so fast and hence extremely useful.
