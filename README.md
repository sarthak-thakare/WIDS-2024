# AI-phabet


Welcome to our project, where we embark on the exciting journey of building an alphabet classifier model to classify handwritten letters captured by a camera. Throughout this endeavor, we'll make use of some essential libraries:

- **Numpy** for efficient matrix manipulations and data processing.
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for visualizing our model's performance.

## Getting Started

In the initial stages, we'll focus on understanding the core concepts of neural networks and developing the intuition behind its working. To fully participate, it's recommended that you have some familiarity with basic linear algebra, particularly in the context of matrix operations at a level akin to MA106.

## Implementation Phase

Once we've laid the foundation, we'll dive into the implementation phase. Here, we'll demystify concepts like 'Feed Forward,' 'Gradient Descent,' 'Backpropagation,' and explore the world of hyperparameters. You'll learn how to fine-tune these hyperparameters to optimize the performance of our model.

## Putting Theory into Practice

With a solid understanding in place, we will translate our knowledge into code and proceed to train the model. We'll use the <so n so> dataset for this purpose, allowing us to apply what we've learned in a practical context.

Let's get started and embark on this exciting journey together!
