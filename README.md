# AI-phabet


Welcome to this project, where we embark on the exciting journey of building an alphabet classifier model to classify handwritten letters captured by a camera.

## Prerequisites

- Some familiarity with basic linear algebra, particularly in the context of matrix operations at a level akin to MA106 is required.
- Basic coding knowledge is a must (CS101 equivalent), experience in python would be really helpful.

## Getting Started (Week 1)

In the initial stages, we'll focus on understanding the core concepts of neural networks and developing the intuition behind its working. You'll also learn about coding in python and some essential python libraries which we'll be using in this project.

We'll make use of the following libraries (you'll be learning these as we go so dont worry if you're not familiar with them):

- **Numpy** for efficient matrix manipulations and data processing.
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for visualizing our model's performance and other metrics.
- **OpenCV** for image preprocessing and character extraction.

## Diving into the theory (Week 2)

Once we've laid the foundation, we'll delve into the mathematical aspects of building a multi-layer neural network. Here, we'll demystify concepts like 'Feed Forward,' 'Gradient Descent,' 'Backpropagation,' and explore the world of hyperparameters. You'll learn how to fine-tune these hyperparameters to optimize the performance of our model.

## Putting Theory into Practice (Week 3 & 4)

With a solid understanding in place, we will translate our knowledge into code and proceed to train the model. 
We'll start by training our model on the [MNIST](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist) dataset, which contains 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits. After successful training, we'll apply the same model to a similar but larger dataset called [EMNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format/). This dataset consists of around 350,000 (28x28 pixel) images of handwritten alphabets. Later in the project, we'll provide modified versions of these datasets for our work.

Let's get started and embark on this exciting journey together!
