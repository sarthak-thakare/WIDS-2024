# Week 4 (Part 1)

In this week, we will build a classifier for MNIST from scratch using just NumPy.
- MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten digits of size 28x28.
- It contains 60000 such images, each stored in the form of 1D arrays of size 28*28=784.
- The dataset therefore has the shape 60000x784.
- We will be importing this dataset using a tensorflow function.

[This](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OL1nFYvkKsB7WoT7POxioZpU2WqO_EYm?usp=sharing) Colab notebook provides a code template where you'll need to complete logical sections of the code.
After succesfully implementing the model, please submit the link to your colab notebook over [here](https://forms.gle/YobyoKxMYmF59C7J6).

After successfully training on MNIST dataset, we'll be implementing our model on the EMNIST dataset(with some small modifications), followed by testing it on custom dataset.
